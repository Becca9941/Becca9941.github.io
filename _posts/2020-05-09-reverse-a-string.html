<h2>Problem Statemest</h2>

<p>Reverse the provided string.</p>

<p>You may need to turn the string into an array before you can reverse it.</p>

<p>Your result must be a string.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Not much to this one. When I didn't include the quotes in .join(), the string had commas between each letter in the string. The quotes joined them with nothing in between the letters.</p>

<pre>
<code>
function reverseString(str) {
  return Array.from(str).reverse().join('');
}

reverseString("hello");
</code>
</pre>
