<p>I got the <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Official-Companion-Guide-Future-Press/9783869931005" target="_blank">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Official Companion Guide</a> yesterday, and love that it tells you what furniture/clothing styles and colors your villagers prefer. If you gift them something with a color or style that they like, then you increase your friendship with them more than if you gifted them something they don't prefer.</p>

<p>I want to use this information to help me decide which items to give my villagers. The problem is that it's tedious to do this. First I have to look at the furniture I have in my inventory, then I have to find the furniture in the companion guide to see what style/color group it belongs to (it's not always obvious), then I have to look up each of my villagers to see if this is something they'd like. Well, that's what I would have to do if I could be bothered to do it.</p>

<p>I thought this would be a great program to write, though it might take a fair bit of data entry to finish. My idea is to be able to select which villagers are currently living on your island, then you can tick off the items in your catalogue. Once you have that data set, you can either select a villager, or an item and it'll recommend which villagers would most like to recieve them. It would be cool if we could keep a record of gifts we have given them too.</p>

<p>To start with, I'll test drive a program that has one villager, and a couple items. I want to build this as a command-line program, so that the GUI is as simple as possible. I'm excited for this one!</p>

<p>In writing...</p>
