<p>UNFINISHED</p>

<p>I am currently working through a fantabulous online course (the first few sections are free) called <a href="https://online-training.jbrains.ca/p/wbitdd-01" target="_blank">The World's Best Intro To TDD</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrains" target="_blank">J.B. Rainsberger.</a></p>

<p>In the <a href="https://online-training.jbrains.ca/courses/wbitdd-01/lectures/133270" target="_blank">Before You Begin</a> section of the course, we are encouraged to set up our testing environment to make it as easy as possible to write and run tests for our code, commit our code to version control, and make our project shippable for others to use.</p>

<p>I'm going to be trying out all of these steps for a new language I am learning called <a href="https://pharo.org/" target="_blank">Pharo</a>, which is based on a pure object-oriented language called Smalltalk. Smalltalk was created by Alan Kay, who said that he regretted callng it an "Object-oriented" language because <a href="https://t.co/YJBNKHO04c?amp=1" target="_blank">it's really about messages.</a></p>

<p>The reason I'm experimenting with this language is because I struggle with understanding the object-oriented paradigm. I think too imperatively right now, so this language might move me closer to unlocking the mental shift I need to be able to think from an Object-Oriented perspective properly.</p>

<h2>My tools</h2>

<p>These are the tools I'm going to be using for my developer environment:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A version control system with an off-site backup (Git and GitHub)</li>
	<li>A testing framework or library for your programming language ()</li>
	<li>A text editor or IDE that you want to master (Pharo Launcher has it's own
		IDE built in)</li>
	<li>A mechanism for running tests with (at most) a single command whilst still
		in your editor ()</li>
	<li>Pen, paper, index cards</li>
</ul>

<h2>Starting a new project in Pharo</h2>

<p>This is going to be a simple "Hello world" project. To start this project, I
opened the "Pharo Launcher" application and double clicked on the "Pharo 6.0
(stable) >> latest-64" image template to create a new <a
	href="http://book.seaside.st/book/getting-started/pharo/what-is-image"
	target="_blank">image</a> for my project, which I called "Hello-World". Double
clicking on the Hello-World image brings up the World for your project where you
can start playing with your code.</p>

<h2>Writing your first test</h2>

<p>Before we are able to write our first test, we need to set up a package for
our project. To do this, we first need to bring up the "System Browser" using the
keyboard shortcut Command-o-b. You can also click anywhere on the World window
and select "System Browser" from the world menu.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/system-browser.png" alt="Pharo's system browser when you first open
it">

<p>When you open the System Browser for the first time in a new Image, there
will be four panels along the top and a single panel spanning the lower half of
the screen. The first panel contains a list of all the packages that are
available for you to use within your project.</p>

<p>We are going to create a new package by clicking on the packages panel and
using the keyboard shortcut Command-n-p. We have named our package
"Hello-World". If it isn't already selected, click on your new package to select
it. The bottom panel of the system browser will then show a class template that
you can use to create new classes for your project. We are now ready to save our
project to version control.</p>

<h2>Saving Pharo (Smalltalk) code to version control.</h2>

<p>Next thing to set up (unfinished)</p>

<h2>Writing your first test</h2>

<p>We are going to write our first test BEFORE we write any code. This is a
Test-Driven Development (TDD) style approach where we write a failing test
first, then the simplest code we can to pass a test, and then refactor to remove
duplication or to make our code more expressive of our intentions.</p>
