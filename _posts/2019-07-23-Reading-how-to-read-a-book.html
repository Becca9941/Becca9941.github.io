<h2>Reading for the sake of increased understanding</h2>

<p>The written world has the power to shape our understanding of who we are and
the environment that surrounds us. Reading allows us to encounter ideas and
perspectives that can shift the trajectory of our lives.</p>

<p>All of the information that we consume leaves some form of residue, an
imprint on our minds and emotions. If we are exposed to these ideas often
enough, they become a part of our own personal narratives.</p>

<p>When encountering an idea for the first time, the narrator who exposes it to
you begins to shape the way that you think about that idea, even if they only
have a little more experience on the topic than you.</p>

<p>If you are disproportionately exposed to the ideas held by one individual or
a like-minded collective, then you become constrained by a narrative that
prevents you from encountering alternative perspectives that may offer benifits
exceeding your own perspective.</p>

<p>Seeking out information, ideas and inspiration from multiple sources allow us
to begin expanding the constraints of our own personal narratives. However, it
isn't enough to just expose ourselves to these thoughts and ideas, because we
only ever see the peak of them, not the history that is woven into the mountain
supporting them.</p>

<p>Have you ever struggled to understand a concept you were studying? Chances
are, you sought out alternative explanations in the hope of finding the piece of
the puzzle that would make everything make sense. When you found the missing
piece, the click moment in your brain was likely audible to the people around
you.</p>

<p>The best sources of information contain insights that are just on the
threshold of your understanding. Where you have to stretch just a little bit to
grasp them. This act of 'stretching' takes effort. Reading for the sake of
increased understanding requires active participation on your part.</p>
