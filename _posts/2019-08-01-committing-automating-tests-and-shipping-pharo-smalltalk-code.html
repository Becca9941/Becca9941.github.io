<p>The instructions below are part of a course called "<a href="https://online-training.jbrains.ca/p/wbitdd-01" target="_blank">The World's Best Intro to TDD</a>" by J.B. Rainsberger, which for me is definitely living up to it's name. The first few sections of the course are free. It's a time investment that'll keep paying off if you choose to work through them.</p>

<blockquote>Before reading any further, set up your working environment. Set up a new, empty project, write a single failing test, run the test and watch the test fail with at most a single keypress,
 commit the failing test to version control, and publish your single failing test offsite.</blockquote>

<p>The genius behind this approach for me is that you are still writing a 'simple' Hello World program, but with all of the things that are essential for bigger projects right from the start.</p>

<p>I'm learning a new language called Pharo, which is a pure Object-Oriented language based on Smalltalk. This entry documents my process of setting up my dev environment in Pharo, but the high-level steps are transferable to other languages.</p>

<p>The tools you need to set up your dev environment according to the course are listed below. I have included the tools I chose in parentheses).</p>

<ul>
  <li>A version control system with an off-site backup (Github)</li>
  <li>A testing frameword or library for your programming language (SUnit for Pharo)</li>
  <li>A text editor or IDE that you want to master (Pharo has it's own IDE, my usual choice is Vim - still learning that one).</li>
  <li>A mechanism for runnig tests wih (at most) a single keypress whilst still in your editor (Iceberg which is built into Pharo)</li>
  <li>Pen, paper, index cards (this is more for the TDD part of the course, but also useful for quickly documenting your installation steps for future reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Writing in progress...</p>
