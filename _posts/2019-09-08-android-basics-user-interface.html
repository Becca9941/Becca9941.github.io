title: android basics user interface
---

<p>Notes are based on <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-interface--ud834" target="_blank">Android Basics: User Interface</a> which is part of a free course created by Google. The entire course teaches you how to get started with building android apps in Kotlin.</p>

<h2>Views</h2>

<p>In android, a view is a rectangle on the screen that shows some content. It can be an image, text a button or anything else that the app can display.</p>

<p>Combined, the individual views make up the layout of the screen. Everything that you see and interact with is known as the User Interface (UI).</p>

<p>You can break down any app into the individual views that make it up. Just draw a rectangle around each of the individual pieces of content, then identify what kind of view it is.</p>

<h2>XML - Extensible Markup Language</h2>

<p>XML is ideal for describing the layout of a screen on an Android app. The layout always consists of one big view which may contain smaller views, which may contain even smaller views.</p>

<p class="note">Wow am I glad to have spent a few years on front-end web development before branching into android. All of this is so much easier to understand.</p>

<h3>Textview code example</h3>

<p>This code displays text an the screen and has a purple background</p>

<pre>
<code>
<TextView
  android:text="Happy Birthday!"
  android:background="@android:color/darker_gray"
  android:layout_width="150dp"
  android:layout_height="75dp" />
</code>
</pre>

<p>'dp' is a unit of measurement like centimeters or millemeters. We use it to describe the size of views as well as the distance between views.</p>

<p>dp stands for <em>density-independent pixels</em> which keeps your views the same size across devices that may have different pixel resolutions.</p>

<p><strong>Google developers on course recommend that buttons should be at least 48dps tall and wide</strong></p>

<pre>
<code>
<TextView
    android:text="Happy Birthday, Berry Boo!"
    android:background="@android:color/darker_gray"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:textSize="36sp"
    android:textColor="@android:color/black"
    android:padding="20dp"
    />
</code>
</pre>

<p>Setting the height and width to 'wrap_content' makes the rectangle around the view the same size as it's containing content.</p>

<p>sp stands for scale independent pixels. This is also a unit of measurement, similar to dp. It makes the app look consistent across different devices. sp is only for fonts because it adjusts based on users preferences and setting for text size.</p>

<h2>Typography</h2>

<h3>Material design type scale</h3>

<p>The following scale is from <a href="https://material.io/design/typography/#type-scale" target="_blank">Googles Material Design System</a>. It shows a combination of 13 text styles that are recommended for different text categories.</p>

<p>You can find a bunch of conversion tables that show you how to convert font-size and letter spacing units <a href="https://material.io/design/typography/#type-scale" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>Ah, while this is all awesom, have just gone down a rabbit hole. Kotlin is awesome and I want to learn it and android properly. I need to set up a kotlin developer environment. But don't need to know how to build an interface just yet, so will skip to the dev environment setup part for now..</p>
