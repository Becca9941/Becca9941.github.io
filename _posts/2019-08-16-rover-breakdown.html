title: Gizmo, a happy little Rover from the tiny red planet called "Objectlins"
---

<p>Say hello to Gizmo, a happy little Rover from the tiny red planet called "Objectlins" where you are not allowed to feed objects messages after midnight, and you most certainly are NOT allowed to get them wet. No one can handle that many instances running around.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/gizmo.svg" alt="little robot with two drawers and three envelopes on his front panel" class="medium-img">

<p>Ever since Gizmo was instantiated, all 2.059 seconds ago, he has been responsible for managing 2 little objects. The thing he loves most about his job is being able to connect objects that work well together.</p>

<p>Gizmo could already tell that these two objects were going to accomplish great things. They were very respectful of each other and never asked for things that didn't belong to them. They also took each of their single responsibilities very seriously. They would never ask the other object to do their work for them. This was going to be an easy job for him.</p>

<p>The two objects in question are called North and Position. Each of them fit in a little drawer inside of Gizmo's chest, very close to his heart. If the requirements were different, he could have been managing any of North's friends. It wouldn't be too long before he'd get to meet them too though, unless the plans were to change. He loved a good plan change. Anything was possible with the right team of objects.</p>

<p>The label on North's drawer is marked with the word "Orientation". Gizmo wondered which Pen object wrote the label. The handwriting was very neat.</p>

<p>The orientation drawer itself was quite small, with room enough only for one. That was okay though, it wasn't meant to be a long-term dwelling. Objects never stayed long once they finished their job, they only had one thing to do after all.</p>

<p>Gizmo thought that for this project, the Orientation drawer was likely to only get three other visitors: East, South and West. If the circumstances required, the drawer would also welcome visits from NorthEast, NorthWest, SouthEast and SouthWest. A cheerful idea, but as it was, they didn't exist yet, and it wasn't certain that they would. Gizmo chuckled at himself, daydreaming again.</p>

<p>The position drawer also had a neatly written label, this time marked with the word "Position". If only he could write like that, but alas he was not a Pen object, but he was a happy little Rover object. This thought made him smile inside.</p>

<p>Oh yes, the position drawer. This also had enough room for one object at a time. Conveniently, this object shared the same name as the drawer, which would make finding it a much easier task for this little object. Wonderful. The turnover rate would likely be similar here too.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/position-object.svg" class="medium-img" alt="little robot with binoculars on top of a set of drawers">

<p>Gizmo especially liked knowing that the behaviour of the Position object and it's successors would be reliable. They always did the same thing. That being said, he could also appreciate the quirky nature of the orientation objects. They all did things a little bit differently, leaving their own mark on the same tasks.</p>

<h2>FIRST MESSAGE RECEIVED</h2>

<p>Gizmo was so excited for this project. He knew that any minute now the Translator object would send him a series of messages telling him what to do next. He hoped that he wouldn't be sent any messages that he couldn't understand. That would be a sad day.</p>

<p>To refresh his memory, Gizmo looked down at the three little envelopes attached below the orientation and position drawers. Each envelope represented a message that he could recieve.</p>

<p>If the name of the message recieved was the same as the name of one of his envelopes, then he would be able to open it up and follow the instructions inside it.</p>

<p>This was always an exciting moment for Gizmo, because he knew that the instructions were for his eyes only. No other object had access to them. It was kind of like ordering a Sushi object. You got to eat the delicious end result but don't get to see the mysterious workings behind how it was made in the Kitchen object.</p>

<p>Gizmo was gently shaken out of his happy little daydream about Sushi instances when a message envelope nudged him a couple of times. Suddenly he could barely contain himself. This was like a Christmas object. He quickly looked at the name of the message and to his absolute joy he saw that he did indeed understand this message.</p>

<p>Gizmo quickly opened up his left envelope. He could now get to work as a project manager, he knew exactly who to delegate the task of turning 90 degrees to the left to, and that was to the current occupant of his orientation drawer, North.</p>

<h2>North recieves 'left' message</h2>

<p>This was quite a nice place, North thought. The drawer was small but plenty of room for one. He remembered the last project he was a part of. He lived in a compass with all of his siblings and cousins. All he could remember was the smell of North-East's lazy susan (the spinny thing that let them all turn around). He didn't think he could eat tuna again after that.</p>

<p>North felt pretty happy with this new assignment. Things could get a little stale when you only had the one responsibility. So it was nice to get a change of scenery, to be a part of something a little different. This was a good life for a North object, even if he didn't really understand why his drawer didn't have his name on it. What did 'orientation' even mean?</p>

<p>It was at that moment that North heard a knocking sound. Suddenly his Heart object rate sped up, it had to be a message. Those were always exciting to recieve.</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> a message, and one he could understand at that. Fantastic! The message he recieved was called 'left'. So he opened his left envelope up. North already knew exactly what he had to do, but he still got a thrill reading the instructions that were a secret to everyone else.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/north-opens-left-message.svg" class="medium-img" alt="north the robot object opens his left message envelope">

<p>North quickly made a phone call to his sister 'West'. It felt good for both of them to vent about NorthEasts lazy susan, and also for North to be able to accomplish his task so quickly.</p>

<p>He told West that it was time for her to return to the Rover. They both chuckled at that too. It was an inside joke that everyone in Objectlin was privy to, to return somewhere that you had never been before</p>

<p>So North put West into the empty 'left' envelope that the Rover sent him. Then he posted it back to the Rover. His job complete, he took one last look around the drawer and left. It was a shame he didn't have time to learn the Rover's name.</p>

<h2>Gizmo meets West</h2>

<p>Gizmo was excited to hear back from North, he couldn't wait to see what would get returned. He knew that North would have known exactly what to do with the message he sent.</p>

<p>The few milliseconds it took for the message result to be returned seemed like a lifetime, but it was definitely worth it to meet West. She told him all about her last assignment, but couldn't understand what she didn't like about the smell of tuna. His stomache grumbled as this reminded him about sushi objects again.</p>

<p>With West returned, Gizmo could complete his own left message by assigning West to the very same drawer that her brother North had just occupied. He was a happy little rover.</p>

<p>Another cool thing about having West stay in his drawer is that his wheels turned him so that he was pointing in the same direction.</p>

<p>West thought Gizmo was lovely, and she felt right at home in the drawer vacated the instant before she accupied it. It was pretty cool not having to wait for the room to be cleaned. The Sailor objects regularly complained about having to wait before checking into Hotel objects whenever the Ship object was being repaired.</p>
