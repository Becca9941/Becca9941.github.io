<p>One of the challenges I set for myself after reading a book called "<a href="2019-07-27-reading-notes-on-how-to-read-a-book.html">How to Read a book</a>" was to work through the elementary reading level. This level talks about the stages of being able to read simple materials as a beginner reader, whether you are a child reading for the first time, or an adult learing a new language for the first time.</p>

<p>The authors of this book say that children who are learning to read for the
first time usually pick up around 400 new words in their first year. Learning
these words enables them to read simple books by themselves.</p>

<p>As an adult learning a new language, I think it'll take far less time for me
to learn 400 words in Russian. I already know the alphabet and basic sentences
like hello, how are you, good morning etc, but want to see if learing words in
isolation will help me be able to read simple books, and infer the meaning of
new words from the context around them.</p>

<p>The app I am going to use for this goal is called <a
                                                       href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.languagedrops.drops.international&hl=en_AU"
                                                       target="_blank">Drops</a>
which is a really friendly app that teaches you new words as well as their
pronunciation.</p>

<p><strong>Start Date:</strong> <time date="2019-07-28">28th July 2019</time></p>
<p><strong>End Date:</strong><time date="">__/__/____</time></p>
<p><strong>Time spent learning 400 Russian words so far</strong>: 15 minutes</p>

<p>I'm going to include icons of the words I have been exposed to in the app so
far. I'll make it so when you click on it, the icon card will flip over and
reveal the Russian word for the icon on the back. I will only mark this
challenge complete once I have correctly spoken the correct Russian word for
each of the 400 icons included below (after 400 icons are there).</p>

<p>I'll only mark this challenge as complete after I have 400 words, and I have
correctly spoken each of their meanings in one go.</p>

<p>My plan is to draw cute icons
for each of them and have them flip over with the Russian word on the back, but
for now will just include the words.</p>
