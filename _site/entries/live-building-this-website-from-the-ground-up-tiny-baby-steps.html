<h1>Follow along as I build this website LIVE from the ground up</h1>

<p>As this site is for documenting everything I learn as I learn it, I thought
it would be cool to have a live build page, sharing every baby step that goes
into making this website. Here are the steps.</p>


<h2>Setting up this live developer journal with a few articles, code snippet
  syntax highlighting and a CSS reset</h2>

<time datetime="2019-07-19">19 JUL 2019</time>

<p>Instead of waiting for this website to be 'ready' before it is published,
I have decided to publish it as a raw HTML site without all of the bells and
whistles. Everything is a work in progress.</p>

<h3><a

    up a Github pages website to host a live developer journal</a></h3>

<p>Github allows you to host your static website (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) for
free. You create a repository for your site which meets the conditions set out
on the <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>
site, and you create your website inside of that repository. My favourite part
about this is that every time I push a code change to the repository from my
local machine, your site is updated within 10 minutes to match the changes. I
may switch to a hosting alternative if at some point a dynamic site becomes a
more appropriate solution.</p>


<h3><a
      href="adding-syntax-highlighting-to-custom-snippets-with-prism.js">Adding
  syntax highlighting to code snippets using Prism</a></h3>

<p>After writing my first raw HTML article, I really didn't like the way that
the code snippets looked. I decided to use Prism because I have used it before
and loved the way it makes my code look. You can customise the color theme for
the code snippets, and you can customise it using your own CSS. I love that
there is syntax highlighting support for most languages in Prism, as well as for
the terminal (called bash/shell in Prism).</p>
