<h1>Developer Journal</h1>

<p>I document most of the things I'm learning as I'm learning them. This
includes step by step installation commands, any advice/feedback, article
snippets and sources, questions I have etc. Your mind is for having ideas,
not for holding them - David Allen.</p>

<p class="note">This site has been purposely published in a raw state to begin
with, so that I can share (and discuss) each of the steps in the
decision-making process.
Also lets me share content without waiting until the site is 'finished'.</p>
