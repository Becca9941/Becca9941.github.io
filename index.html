  <p>A live developer journal captures your failures, misunderstandings, struggles and the resulting lightbulb moments that propel you forward.</p>

  <p>I build programs that are tested, principle-driven, version controlled, improved by feedback and shippable to the best of my ability, based on the knowledge I hold at the time they are being built.</p>

  <p><em>Your keyboard holds a million bad programs, and your job is to get them out.</em></p>

  <p>Many of the things that influence my journey to becoming a better developer have nothing to do, but also everything to do with tech. The intersections between your home and away disciplines are unexpected, and fascinating.</p>

  <p>This is my unique garden of hybrid knowledge plants.</p>

  <p>Welcome! ☀️  🌱  💡  📚  📝  🌈  🌻</p>
