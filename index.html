  <h1>Developer Journal</h1>

  <p>I document most of the things I'm learning as I'm learning them. This
  includes step by step installation commands, any advice/feedback, article
  snippets and sources, questions I have etc. Your mind is for having ideas,
  not for holding them - David Allen.</p>

  <p class="note">This site has been purposely published in a raw state to begin
  with, so that I can share (and discuss) each of the steps in the
  decision-making process.
  Also lets me share content without waiting until the site is 'finished'.</p>
