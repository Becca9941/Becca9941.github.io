<h1>Follow along as I build this website LIVE from the ground up</h1>

<p>As this site is for documenting everything I learn as I learn it, I thought
it would be cool to have a live build page, sharing every baby step that goes
into making this website. Here are the steps.</p>


<h2>Setting up this live developer journal with a few articles, code snippet
  syntax highlighting and a CSS reset</h2>

<time datetime="2019-07-19">19 JUL 2019</time>

<p>Instead of waiting for this website to be 'ready' before it is published,
I have decided to publish it as a raw HTML site without all of the bells and
whistles. Everything is a work in progress.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was <a
  href="setting-up-github-pages-for-a-static-developer-journal.html">set up
  Github pages site</a> to host this developer journal website on. Then I wrote
an article about it and added a link to it on the home page.</p>

<p>As this website build is not my priority right now, I'm usually making
changes to make my life easier, or to solve something that's pretty annoying.
The first thing that bothered me was the state of my code snippets. In raw HTML,
they don't look very good. So I installed <a href="https://prismjs.com/"
                                             target="_blank">Prism</a>, which is
                                           a syntax highlighting tool for code
                                           snippets. Instructions for doing this
                                           are on the prism website. You can
                                           change the styles in the prism.css
                                           file to suit your branding better. I
changed my code snippets so that they were fullscreen and had a darker
background</p>
